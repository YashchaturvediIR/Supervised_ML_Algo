# Supervised_ML_Algo

This repository contains implementations of major supervised machine learning algorithms, including Huber Regression, Linear Regression, RANSAC Regression, and TheilSen Regression. The repository uses a dataset consisting of `train.csv` and `test.csv` for training and testing the models respectively.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of several key supervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are fundamental for understanding regression problems and are widely used in various applications.

## Algorithms

### Huber Regression
Huber Regression is robust to outliers in the dataset. It uses a combination of squared error and absolute error to provide a balance between the two.

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a basic and commonly used algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.

### RANSAC Regression
RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) Regression is an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data which contains outliers.

### TheilSen Regression
TheilSen Regression is a robust linear regression method that estimates the slope as the median of the slopes of all lines through pairs of points.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this repository includes:
- `train.csv`: Contains the training data used to fit the models.
- `test.csv`: Contains the testing data used to evaluate the models.
